Suggestions for presentation:
0a) Where data is from
0b) What are we trying to accomplish
1) Start with US map for all 50 states. 2 graphs - one for 2011 and 2016
2) Show line charts with the 7 states
3) Dynamic chart and explain results/ tell story
4) Linear regression results. Show statistically significant results. If not, then say something like it's not statistically significant BUT.....
